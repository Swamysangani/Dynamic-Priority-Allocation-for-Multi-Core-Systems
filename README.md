# Dynamic-Priority-Allocation-for-Multi-Core-Systems
 A dynamic priority allocation  system for multi-core processors,  enhancing task scheduling
Overview
This work centers on efficient task scheduling on multi-core processors through dynamic modification of priorities. Rather than having static priority assignment, which wastes resources, dynamic priority modification for task scheduling directs CPU resources exactly where they are needed in light of real-time workload requirements. 

Why It Matters
The conventional scheduling approaches inevitably lead to resource underutilization or excessive latency. With dynamic priority assignment, the tasks are allocated priorities according to system loads such as CPU utilization, task execution duration, and real-time requirements. This boosts performance, avoids bottlenecks, and enhances system efficiency.

How It Works
Real-Time Monitoring: The processor loads and task execution patterns are constantly monitored by the system.

Adaptive Scheduling: The priorities are dynamically changed to avoid resource starvation and optimize CPU utilization.

Performance Optimization: Schedules high-priority tasks to be run without undue delays while ensuring fairness among all the tasks.

Use Cases
Real-time constrained embedded systems

High-performance computing environments

Multi-threaded applications where CPU optimization is required
